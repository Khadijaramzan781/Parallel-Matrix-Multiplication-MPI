🚀 Parallel Matrix Multiplication Performance Analysis
Block Checkerboard Decomposition vs. Cannon's Algorithm

📌 Project Overview
This research-based project evaluates the performance and scalability of dense matrix multiplication (100 \times 100) using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The study compares two sophisticated distributed memory algorithms to quantify the trade-offs between computational speed and communication overhead in a multi-core environment.

🧠 Technical Deep-Dive: Why These Results?
1. Hardware Constraint (The Quad-Core Limit)
Since the testing environment was a Quad-Core machine, the performance peaked exactly at n=4 processes. Beyond this, the system lacked physical cores to handle additional MPI processes, leading to context-switching overhead that prevented further speedup.

2. Amdahl’s Law & Scalability Saturation
For a small matrix size (100 \times 100), the computational workload was insufficient to justify higher parallelism. The results provide a practical demonstration of Amdahl’s Law: the speedup is limited by the sequential component (communication).

3. Communication-Bound vs. Computation-Bound
As the number of processors increased, the sub-matrix size assigned to each core became too small. The time spent on MPI communication (scattering, shifting, and gathering data) exceeded the time spent on actual math. This shifted the system from being computation-bound to communication-bound.

4. Algorithm Trade-offs
Block Checkerboard slightly outperformed Cannon's Algorithm in this specific scenario. Cannon's requires complex initial alignment (skewing) and circular shifts. At this small scale, these extra communication steps introduced an overhead that outweighed the benefits of its theoretically optimal design.
